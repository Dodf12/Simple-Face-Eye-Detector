# Simple-Face-Eye-Detector
After dabbling around in Open Cv Python, I made this simple little eye/face detector that connects to your webcam.

To use this, download the file. In command prompt type dir, and then cd to the place where you downloaded the file. Run by saying "python eyedetector.py". Should work
Lemme know if it doesn't
